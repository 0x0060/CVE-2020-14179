## Overview

This repository contains a Python script designed to exploit CVE-2020-14179, a vulnerability affecting Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center versions prior to 8.5.8 and from 8.6.0 to 8.11.1. The vulnerability allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to view custom field names and custom SLA names via an Information Disclosure vulnerability in the `/secure/QueryComponent!Default.jspa` endpoint.

The script sends HTTP requests to a specified URL or a list of URLs and checks if the target is vulnerable to CVE-2020-14179 by analyzing the response for specific searchers.
